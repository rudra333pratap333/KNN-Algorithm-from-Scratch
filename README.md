# KNN-Algorithm-from-Scratch

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm(KNN) is simple superwise machine learning algorithm, used for classification of objects of two or more than two classes based on how much number of data points lie if we consider N no of closest data points to the test data. The class whose maximum objects belongs to the N closest data-points KNN algorithm simply tells us that this data point belogs to that class.
